<h4><b>Parts</b><h4>

1. (2) Adafruit Huzzah32 – ESP32 Feather Board (pre-soldered) (https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/3591/8119805) This board is slightly more expensive than other ESP32 boards but it was chosen because it comes with a battery charger, JST connection, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Classic/LE support all on one board. </li>

2. (2) Capacitive Rotary encoders https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/cui-devices/amt103-v/827016

3. (2) 1/4in.(6.35mm)x85mm round metal rods. Note: Rod selection was based partly on availability in our area. For this reason, the holes in the 3D print model are designed to accommodate a 1/4in. (6.35mm) rod. The feel of the rotation can be affected if the gap between the base holes and the rod is too large, so we recommend adjusting the 3D print model to accommodate what is available in your area. The rotary encoders come with a variety of sleeve sizes and can accommodate a broad range of diameters.
