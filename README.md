<h1>MMM Duet System</h1>


<h2>Welcome to the MMM Duet System open access build instructions.</h2>



<p>On this site, you will find instructions for how to create your own MMM Duet System. We provide instructions for users who would like to build and use the devices to play musical duets together. We also provide information for researchers and developers who might like to use the MMM Duet System in their research and/or further develop the MMM Duet System. </p>

<h3><u>Instructions for users who would like to build and use the devices:</u></h3>
You will need the following software packages.
<ul>
<li>Max 8 or newer </li>
<li>Arduino 1.7 or newer</li>
</ul>

You will also need access to a 3D printer.
<ul><li>
For users who are unfamiliar with 3D printing technology, see https://www.pcmag.com/news/3d-printing-what-you-need-to-know  for an introduction. Note that 3D printing services can be found online or locally. For example, in MMM Duet System’s birthplace, 3D Printing services are available through the public library: https://www.wheatland.sk.ca/services/3D_printing and through a number of 3D printing companies. We used a Prusa i3 MKSS printer with PLA filament for early prototyping and ASA for stronger results in later prototypes. The 3D printing community is very helpful and welcoming if you are having any issues (https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/, https://forum.prusa3d.com/). Please note that many users’ 3D printing setups show no ventilation, but we strongly advise venting the printer directly outside.</li></ul>

Here are the steps to follow to build your MMM Duet System.
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions on the MMM Duet System Hardware folder to build your device. </li> 
<li>Follow the instructions on the MMM Duet System Software folder to set up the software. Once this step is complete, you will be able to play duets of various songs that are included in the software package. </li> 
<li>Follow the instructions on the Creating Duets from Commercial Recordings if you’d like to expand the selection of songs to include your personal favourites.</li> 
</ol>

<h3><u>Information for researchers and developers:</u></h3>
<p>To build the MMM Duet System, follow the same instructions as provided for users. Then consult the additional documentation we have provided for developers for further information about how the hardware and software were built and can be modified.</p>
